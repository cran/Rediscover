Description: An optimized method for identifying mutually 
    exclusive genomic events.  Its main contribution is a
    statistical analysis based on the Poisson-Binomial 
    distribution that takes into account that some samples
    are more mutated than others. See [Canisius, Sander, John WM Martens,
    and  Lodewyk FA Wessels. (2016)  "A novel independence test for
    somatic alterations in cancer shows that 
    biology drives mutual exclusivity but chance explains
    most co-occurrence." Genome biology 17.1 : 1-17. <doi:10.1186/s13059-016-1114-x>].
    The mutations matrices are sparse matrices. The method developed takes 
    advantage of the advantages of this type of matrix to save 
    time and computing resources.
